                    <p class="mb-4">This model would deeply integrate the principles and practices of Model United Nations across the entire curriculum. From an early age, students would regularly engage in simulations of UN bodies, debating global issues, drafting resolutions, and honing skills in international relations, diplomacy, critical thinking, research, and public speaking.</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium italic">Why it aligns with Quaker values: The MUN model inherently promotes peaceful conflict resolution, dialogue, and understanding across diverse cultures, aligning directly with the Quaker testimonies of Peace and Community. Its emphasis on thorough research and critical analysis of global issues resonates with the Quaker pursuit of Truth.</p>
