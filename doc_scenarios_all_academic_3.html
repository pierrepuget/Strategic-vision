                    <p class="mb-4">This niche involves fully embracing an educational philosophy centered on active, hands-on learning, inquiry-driven projects, and true student agency. It's a deliberate move away from traditional lecture-based instruction and rote memorization.</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium italic">Why it aligns with Quaker values: The emphasis on student-centered learning and nurturing individual talents directly aligns with uncovering and developing each person's "inner light." Encouraging students to question, explore, and test ideas through experience mirrors the Quaker pursuit of truth. Teamwork and community-based projects reinforce our testimonies of community and service.</p>
