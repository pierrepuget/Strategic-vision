It integrates explicit instruction and experiential learning in areas like integrity, empathy, resilience, and a commitment to service and justice.</p>

                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Conflict Resolution Expertise:</strong> Students would be equipped with non-violent communication and restorative justice practices.</li>

                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Authentic Curriculum Integration:</strong> The integration needs to be thoughtful and authentic, not just an add-on. Some concern has been raised about DEIJ efforts being perceived as "performative."</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Addressing Behavioral Issues:</strong> Bullying incidents, which have been reported as not always sufficiently addressed, would need to be a clear focus.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Expanding Community Engagement:</strong> There are opportunities for more community service activities and for the Peace Choir to perform outside of school.</li>
