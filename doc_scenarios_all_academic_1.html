                    <p class="mb-4">This path envisions SCFS as a leader in providing specialized, individualized support for students with a range of learning needsâ€”from dyslexia and ADHD to executive function challenges. Our goal would be to create an environment where these students don't just get by, but truly thrive and reach their fullest potential.</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium italic">Why it aligns with Quaker values: This direction deeply aligns with the belief in "That of God in everyone," emphasizing the unique potential of every individual. It is also well-suited to the needs of students with disabilities due to its alignment with the Quaker values of individualized attention, equality, community, simplicity, and peace.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">The Upsides (Pros):</h4>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Truly Personalized Attention:</strong> Our smaller class sizes and favorable student-to-teacher ratios offer the kind of intensive one-on-one or small-group instruction that larger public schools often struggle to provide.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Specialized Teaching:</strong> We'd be able to implement proven methodologies such as Orton-Gillingham, multi-sensory learning, executive function coaching, and tailored social-emotional curricula specifically designed for neurodiverse learners.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">A Welcoming & Inclusive Culture:</strong> SCFS already fosters an environment where differences are celebrated.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Meeting a Real Need:</strong> There is a clear demand for more tailored support than what is typically available in public school settings.</li>

                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Staffing Needs:</strong> There is a recognized need for more support staff, including a dedicated emotional support teacher and a school counselor.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Perception Management:</strong> We'd need to clearly communicate the specific learning differences we address and actively counter a past misconception that SCFS is for children with "behavioral problems."</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-gray-900">Limited Financial Resources:</strong> Our limited financial resources could pose a challenge to making the necessary investments in specialized staff and programs.</li>
