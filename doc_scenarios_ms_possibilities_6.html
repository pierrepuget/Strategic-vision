                        This framework shifts the focus away from traditional letter grades and standardized tests as the primary measure of learning. Instead, students would build comprehensive portfolios of their work throughout middle school. Learning would culminate in public exhibitions or presentations where students showcase their growth and defend their understanding.

                        Why it aligns with Quaker values: It deeply honors each student's unique learning journey and values their process and self-reflection, embodying "Inner Light" and individual growth. It promotes honest self-assessment and a genuine understanding of mastery, reflecting Integrity. It also strengthens community bonds by celebrating learning.
