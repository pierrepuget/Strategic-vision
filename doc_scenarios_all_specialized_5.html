                        This niche would establish a comprehensive focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), integrating these disciplines across the entire curriculum with an emphasis on hands-on, problem-based learning.

                        Why it aligns with Quaker values: A STEM focus aligns with the Quaker pursuit of "Truth" through scientific inquiry and critical analysis. The collaborative nature of many STEM projects reinforces the Quaker testimony of "Community." Applying solutions to real-world problems can embody "Service," while ethical considerations in technology align with "Integrity."
