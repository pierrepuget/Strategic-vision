                    <p class="mb-4">This framework would dedicate specific blocks of time (e.g., a few weeks each semester) to intensive, student-selected "Deep Dive" electives. These wouldn't be full-year courses, but short, highly focused, passion-driven explorations.</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium italic">Why it aligns with Quaker values: It directly nurtures individual passions and talents, allowing students to explore what truly resonates with them, embodying "Inner Light." It encourages deep investigation into specific topics, aligning with Inquiry. It also fosters community among students and teachers who share a common interest.</p>
