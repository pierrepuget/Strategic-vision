                    <p class="mb-4">This niche involves offering a highly enriched and flexible curriculum specifically designed for gifted learners. It would foster deep inquiry, interdisciplinary studies, and creative problem-solving, while also providing robust social-emotional support tailored to their unique needs.</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium italic">Why it aligns with Quaker values: This approach nurtures the "Inner Light" by cultivating unique intellectual and creative gifts. Inquiry and seeking truth align with the inherent curiosity of gifted individuals. It provides individualized attention for a specific learning profile and fosters a community where gifted students can connect with peers who share their intellectual intensity.</p>
