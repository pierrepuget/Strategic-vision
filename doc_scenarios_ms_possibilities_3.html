                        This framework would connect middle school students with adult mentorsâ€”both teachers within the school and experts from the local community. Students would engage in "apprenticeship-like" experiences, working alongside mentors on real projects or pursuing deep dives into areas of personal interest.

                        Why it aligns with Quaker values: It connects students deeply with the wider community and encourages them to use their learning in service to others, building meaningful relationships.
