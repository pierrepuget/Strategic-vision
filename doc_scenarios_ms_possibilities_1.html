                    <p class="mb-4">This is what the school is already doing, directly embracing its small size by having flexible, multi-age groupings instead of strict single-grade classrooms. Learning is highly individualized, with a strong emphasis on peer mentorship.</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium italic">Why it aligns with Quaker values: This model inherently builds a deep, supportive, and family-like community where everyone knows and supports each other, truly living out the Quaker testimony of Community. It allows for unparalleled individual attention, honoring each student's "Inner Light." Every student's contribution is valued, embodying Equality.</p>
