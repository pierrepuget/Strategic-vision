                    <p class="mb-4">This niche places a strong emphasis on visual and performing arts, not just as standalone subjects but as integral components woven across all academic disciplines, enriching and enhancing core learning.</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium italic">Why it aligns with Quaker values: The arts offer a profound avenue for individuals to express their unique "inner spirit" and understanding of the world. Many artistic endeavors require collaboration and mutual support, reinforcing the Quaker testimony of community. Arts provide a rich language for students to communicate their thoughts, feelings, and insights, aligning with "letting their lives speak."</p>
