                    <p class="mb-4">This niche offers a truly bespoke educational experience for every student, acknowledging that all children learn differently, even without a formal diagnosis. It involves flexible pacing, mastery-based learning, individualized learning plans for all students, and a strong emphasis on student-led goal setting and reflection.</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium italic">Why it aligns with Quaker values: This approach honors the unique learning journey and "inner light" of every student. It extends the Quaker value of nurturing the individual to every student's academic path. The emphasis on student-led goal setting and reflection aligns with Quaker practices of introspection and self-discovery, and the principle of equality ensures every student receives the specific support and challenge they need.</p>
