                    <p class="mb-4">This means adopting the globally recognized International Baccalaureate (IB) framework, specifically the Primary Years Programme (PYP) and Middle Years Programme (MYP). This implies a rigorous, inquiry-based curriculum focused on developing knowledgeable, compassionate, and lifelong learners.</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 font-medium italic">Why it aligns with Quaker values: The IB's emphasis on global awareness, peaceful conflict resolution, and making a positive impact resonates deeply with Quaker testimonies of peace, integrity, and social justice. Its commitment to nurturing the "whole child" mirrors the Quaker belief in developing each individual's "inner light."</p>
